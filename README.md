# Full-Stack Development with MERN stack.
Whether you want to broaden your horizon by learning new technologies or need a new approach at work, this course will help you fast-track your development with the MERN stack. Whatever the case, learning to develop with the MERN stack is one of the most considered trades in technology trends relating to React/Native. Implementing software with the MERN stack enables you to scale, test, and maintain your codebase more efficiently. That is, the MERN stack is optimal for performant web and mobile applications.

This module introduces you to software development with the MERN stack, which will set you off to build reliable, scalable, and robust software in terms of its full-stack implementation. The modules herein are structured to take you from intermediate development experience to more advanced concepts in a way that interconnects the units to one another. Consequently, it is crucial to go through the modules from first to last. 

## Module Guideline:

Watch every video within a module and complete the final projects provided as an assessment of your knowledge for the given module.
Working with a notebook and taking notes of key concepts in each module will help you concretize what you have learned.
We use GitHub classrooms for final assessments for each module. Each module will contain tests for the given knowledge sets which we intend to cover for the module.
Post questions in the comments section for every module and ensure that you enable notifications for when the lecturer responds to your query.
Keep your eye on the live lecture schedules if there are any for your module.
