# Full-Stack Development with MERN stack.
Whether you want to broaden your horizon by learning new technologies or need a new approach at work, this course will help you fast-track your development with the MERN stack. Whatever the case, learning to develop with the MERN stack is one of the most considered trades in technology trends relating to React/Native. Implementing software with the MERN stack enables you to scale, test, and maintain your codebase more efficiently. That is, the MERN stack optimal for performant web and mobile applications.

This module introduces you to software development with the MERN stack, which will set you off to build reliable, scalable, and robust software in terms of its full-stack implementation. The modules herein are structured to take you from intermediate development experience to more advanced concepts in a way that interconnects the units to one another. Consequently, it is crucial to go through the modules from first to last. 

## Module Guideline:

Watch every video within a module and complete the final projects provided as an assessment of your knowledge for the given module.
Working with a notebook and taking notes of key concepts in each module will help you concretize what you have learned.
We use GitHub classrooms for final assessments for each module. Each module will contain tests for the given knowledge sets which we intend to cover for the module.
Post questions in the comments section for every module and ensure that you enable notifications for when the lecturer responds to your query.
Keep your eye on the live lecture schedules if there are any for your module.

## Command line operations to setup environment:

### Prerequisites

To follow this steps along it will be helpful to have the following:

- A prior experience of Node.js, Express, npm, and React.js.
- Node.js installed.
- A text editor, preferably VS Code.
- A web browser, in this case, Google Chrome.

### Instructions

- The first thing you need to do is to create a new express application. To do so, you need to have `npm` installed. You can install NPM by following this [link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and installing a version compatible with your operating system. Instructions on setting up environment will be provided in the first video related to this module.
- After installing NPM as discribed above, you need to setup development dependencies from the command line with the following series of commands:

- #### First, you need to ensure that you have an Express application generator installed.
- - Run `npm install -g express-generator`.

- #### Now, you need to generate a new application with express.
- - Note that in this example we generate a new application running with a view templating language called [pug](https://pugjs.org/), and the name of the application is backend-skeleton.
- - Run `npx express-generator --view=pug backend-skeleton`.
- - Once you've done the above, you should be able to cd into the backend-skeleton application with the following command.
- - Run `cd backend-skeleton`.
- - Once you ran the above command, you should be able to install all dependencies which will be populated in a folder called `node_modules`. Node modules is the root folder which will contain all project files which are external to what you have developed--for now, let's call them dependencies. More on this later.
- - Run `npm install`.
